Actions

Implement a model in Jupyter Notebook and discuss the followings:

Describe the problem:

    What is the problem?
    What is the type of machine learning?
    What are the feature variables and target variables?

Data exploration and preprocessing:

    How did you explore the data?
    How did you clean the data (are there missing or invalid values)?

Modeling:

    Split 20% data as the test set using the random status 123.
    What machine learning algorithms were used? Which is better?
    What evaluation metric do you prefer?
    How did you evaluate model's performance?
    How did you diagnose the model? Is it overfitting, under fitting, or good fitting?

Results and discussion:

    What is your model's results? Is it good? Do you have any concerns?
